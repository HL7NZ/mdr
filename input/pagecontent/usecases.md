# Use cases

The below use cases are examples of approved uses of the information held in MDR:

## Medicines reconciliation

The process of confirming what medication a consumer is currently or has recently taken. This
process is normally undertaken prior to any medical intervention by a health professional.

## Medicines adherence

The process of confirming what medication a consumer is currently taking based on what was
prescribed. This process is normally undertaken when a consumer is not responding as expected to
the medication prescribed.

## Real-time access to controlled drug prescribing

This involves access to the medicines data for a prescriber wanting to inquire about an individualâ€™s
history before prescribing controlled drugs. The primary purpose is to ensure that the consumer is
not unwittingly over-prescribed controlled drugs.
